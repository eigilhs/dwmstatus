/* == CPU ==
 * CPU load info is stored in s->cpu[0].prct through s->cpu[N+1].prct
 * where N is the machine's number of CPUs. s->cpu[0].prct is the
 * total, and the rest are for specific CPUs.
 *
 * == MEMORY ==
 * s->mem_total holds total memory installed, and s->mem_avail holds
 * the amount of "available" memory.
 *
 * == TEMPERATURE ==
 * The value of the temperature sensors defined in DS_TEMP_SENSORS
 * can be read from s->temp[i] where "i" is the index of the sensor.
 *
 * == WIFI ==
 * s->winfo->b.essid holds the current ESSID, and s->winfo->bitrate->value
 * holds the bitrate.
 *
 * == POWER ==
 * s->ba_status holds 'C' when charging, 'D' when discharging, 'F' when
 * fully charged, and 'A' when on AC but not charging.
 *
 * == TIME ==
 * A string with current localtime formatted as described in DS_TIME_FORMAT
 * can be found in s->time.
